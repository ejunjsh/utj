# test result

this error is not soon to happen  until your vm memory is full.

the `MaxDirectMemorySize` jvm parameter is not work to limit usage of direct memory

so the method is same as the 02-05,limit the docker memory and disable the swap memory.

but the error alway show like below

````
jdk6_1  | Killed
0209_jdk6_1 exited with code 137
````

wait my time again.
